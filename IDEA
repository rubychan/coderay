Website tools:
- convertor: reads and writes HTML (filter)
	<code lang="ruby">bla</code>
	=>
	<code class="CodeRay">...</code>

- manual highlighter:
	1. idea:
		special scanner (simply reading raydebug code should be enough)
		=> makes it possible, easy to write
		
	2. idea:
		=> cooler, but more advanced
		=> still easy to implement for all scanners at once
		preamble function (wrapper for scanners):
		for example, a method def:
			def foo
		shall be shown in the same color as method(foo), but
		without the def. so write:
			!def !foo
		Input is read into def foo and 4 (number of chars in preamble)
		Ruby scanner outputs some Tokens:
			reserved(def) method(foo)
		and chopped by a chop_preamble method giving:
			method(foo)			
		PreambleTokens subclass?
		Tokens instance that takes options?
	
	3. idea:
		Scanner handled solution --> forget it.
