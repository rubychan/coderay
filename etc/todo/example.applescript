(* Application.applescript *)

(* This example employs many UI features in Cocoa, such as a 'drawer' and 'panels' as well as using the 'do shell script' to provide a UI frontend to the 'gnutar' shell tool to build tar archives. It also demonstrates how to design an application that is a droplet as well. You can also fine an example of how to use the 'user-defaults' class. *)

(* The structure of this script is as follows:
	Properties		Properties needed for the application.
	Event Handlers	Handlers that are called by actions in the UI.
	Handlers 		Handlers that are called within the script.
*)

(* ==== Properties ==== *)

-- Settings
property openWindowOnLaunch : true
property showProgress : true
property compressArchive : true
property preserveIDs : true
property followLinks : false
property verboseMode : false
property defaultLocation : ""

-- Others
property windowOpened : false
property progressPanel : missing value
property fileNames : {}
property filesDataSource : missing value


(* ==== Event Handlers ==== *)

-- This event handler is called as early in the process of launching an application as is possible. The handler is a good place to register our settings as well as read in the current set of settings. 
-- 
on will finish launching theObject
	set windowOpened to false
	
	registerSettings()
	readSettings()
end will finish launching

-- This event handler is the last handler called in the process of launching an application. If the handler is called and a window hasn't been shown yet (via the 'open' event handler) then we need to show the main window here (as well was opening the settings drawer).
-- 
on launched theObject
	if windowOpened is false then
		showWindow()
		showSettings()
	end if
end launched

-- This event handler is called when the object that is associated with it is loaded from its nib file. It's a good place to do any one-time initialization, which in this case is to create the data source for the table view.
--
on awake from nib theObject
	-- Create the data source for the table view
	set filesDataSource to make new data source at end of data sources with properties {name:"files"}
	
	-- Create the "files" data column
	make new data column at end of data columns of filesDataSource with properties {name:"files"}
	
	-- Assign the data source to the table view
	set data source of theObject to filesDataSource
	
	-- Register for the "file names" drag types
	tell theObject to register drag types {"file names", "color"}
end awake from nib

	-- Get the list of data types on the pasteboard
	set dataTypes to types of pasteboard of dragInfo

-- This event handler is called when you drag any file/folder items in the Finder onto the application icon (either in the Finder or in the Dock).

(* Assistant.applescript *)

(* This application is to present one possible implementation of an 'Assistant'. The strategy that is used is to use a tab view and use seperate tab view items to represent an information panel. The tab view is set without a border or visible tabs. This gives the appearance of a panel full of UI elements to being switched in and out. The design also supports the ability to easily add, remove or change the order of info panels. One thing of note is that and that is incorporated in this strategy is that UI elements of tab view items that are not the current tab view item are not accessible. The way a tab view works is by adding and removing the tab view item's view in and out of the view hierarchy. Since AppleScript needs to be able to walk that view hierarchy to get access to the UI elements in the sub views. Thus, the properties of each info panel is updated before the tab view item is switched out. *)

(* The structure of this script is as follows:
	Properties		Properties needed for the application.
	Script Objects		Model/Controller objects that are specific to each info panel.
	Event Handlers	Handlers that are called by actions in the UI.
	Handlers 			Handlers that interact with the script objects and as well as the UI.

You choose how to search by choosing from several choices in a popup button: "begins with", "contains", "ends with" and "is". The strategy employed is to get a list of all of the command names at starup and then search through that list when requested, displaying the results of the ones found. *)

(* ==== Event Handlers ==== *)

-- The "will finish launching" event handler is the first event handler called in the startup sequence and is a good place to do any type of initialization work that doesn't require any UI. For this example we will get a list of all of the command names.
--
on will finish launching theObject
	-- The quickest method of getting a list of all of the command names appears to be to get the information using "ls" in a "do shell script". We want to get a list of all of the commands from the following locations: /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin. We can do this by concating the commands together with the ";" character and then piping ("|") the results through the "sort" shell command passing it the "-u" option which eliminates any duplicates. We then take the result from the do shell command (which will be a string with return characters between each item) and convert it to a list of strings.
	set commandNames to every paragraph of (do shell script "ls /usr/bin ; ls /usr/sbin ; ls /bin | sort -u")
end will finish launching

(* Document.applescript *)

(* This is a very simple example of how to write a document based plain text editor. It takes advantage of the lower level handlers for document handling, namely "read from file" and "write to file". It does this so that it can read text documents created by other applications. The two higher level handlers "data representation" and "load data representation" allow you to return and set any type of data, but then it will only be readable by your application, as it utilizes Cocoa's NSData object to store and retrieve your data. *)

(* ==== Event Handlers ==== *)

-- The "read from file" handler is called when the document needs to the data to be read from disk. "theObject" is the document object, "pathName" contains the POSIX style path of the file to read and "ofType" contains the type of document to read (which by default this value will be "DocumentType" as set up in the documents section of the target editor for document based Studio applications).
--
on read from file theObject path name pathName of type ofType
	-- Open the file so that we can read it in
	set theFile to open for access (pathName as POSIX file)
	
	-- Read the data in
	set theData to read theFile as string
	
	-- Close the file
	close access theFile
	
	-- Put the data that we read into the text view of our document
	set contents of text view "editor" of scroll view "editor" of window of theObject to theData
	
	-- We need to return true (if everything went well) or false (if something failed). For the purposes of this example we'll signal that everything went well.
	return true
end read from file


-- The "write to file" handler is called when the document needs to be saved to disk. "theObject" is the document object, "pathName" contains the POSIX style path of the file to write and "ofType" contains the type of document to read (which by default this value will be "DocumentType" as set up in the documents section of the target editor for document based Studio applications).
--
on write to file theObject path name pathName of type ofType
	-- Get the data from the text view of the document
	set theData to contents of text view "editor" of scroll view "editor" of window of theObject
	
	-- Open the file for writing
	set theFile to open for access (pathName as POSIX file) with write permission
	
	-- Write the data
	write theData to theFile as string
	
	-- Close the file
	close access theFile
	
	-- We need to return true (if everything went well) or false (if something failed). For the purposes of this example we'll signal that everything went well.

(* WithoutDataSource.applescript *)

(* This script is used to demonstrate the scripting of a table view without using a data source. The important part of supplying the table with information is in the "cell value" and "number of rows" event handlers. The table will query the script asking it for the number of rows, and then for every row of every column the "number of rows" event handler will be called, returning the contents of the cell for the table to display. *)

(* Document.applescript *)

(* This is a good example of several different features of AppleScript Studio. The main one is to demonstrate how to write a document bases application using the higher level handlers "data representation" and "load data representation" (as opposed to the lower level handlers "write to file" and "read from file". It also demonstrates how to work with a table view (including support for sorting). Menu Item handling is also included in this example. *)

(* XMethods Service Finder.applescript *)

(* This is an example that demonstrates how to use Web Services. It utilizes a service from XMethods.org that provides information about all of the services available at their site. It also demonstrates how to create and use data sources for a table view. *)

(* The strategy used in this script is to populate the "services" list with all of the services avialable (which is also used to populate the "all services" data source. Then whenever a "find" is requested, the "found services" list is filled out the listing found in the "services" list, and then a new temporary data source is created, using the "found services" list to populate it. That data source is then set as the current data source of the table. If the user deletes the search text field, then the data rows of the "found services" data source are removed and the "all services" data source is set to be the current data source of the table view. In essence, it's just a matter of switching in and out the "all services" and "found services" data sources according to the actions of the user. *)
